                    <li>⅓ cup fresh basil leaves</li>
                    <li>¼ cup fresh cilantro, chopped</li>
                    <li>½ lemon, juiced</li>
                    <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
                    <li>4 ounces portobello mushroom caps, sliced</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p><h3>Directions</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Place the sun-dried tomatoes in a bowl with 1 cup water. Soak 30 minutes, until rehydrated. Drain, reserving water, and chop.</li>
                    <li>In a medium saucepan, combine the reserved sun-dried tomato water with enough water to yield 1 1/2 cups. Bring to a boil. Stir in the couscous. Cover, remove from heat, and allow to sit 5 minutes, until liquid has been absorbed. Gently fluff with a fork.</li>
                    <li>Heat the olive oil in a skillet. Stir in the sun-dried tomatoes, garlic, and green onions. Cook and stir about 5 minutes, until the green onions are tender. Mix in the basil, cilantro, and lemon juice. Season with salt and pepper. Mix in the mushrooms, and continue cooking 3 to 5 minutes. Toss with the cooked couscous to serve.</li>
